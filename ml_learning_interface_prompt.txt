ONE-SHOT PROMPT: INTERACTIVE MACHINE LEARNING LEARNING INTERFACE
================================================================================

Create a comprehensive, interactive HTML interface for learning machine learning fundamentals with a focus on backpropagation, gradient descent, and neural network architectures. The interface should be self-contained (single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript) and provide intuitive, visual explanations of complex concepts.

================================================================================
CORE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

1. VISUAL CURVE FITTING DEMONSTRATION
   - Interactive canvas showing data points and a polynomial curve
   - 6 adjustable sliders for parameters k0 through k5 representing:
     y(x) = k0 + k1*x + k2*x² + k3*x³ + k4*x⁴ + k5*x⁵
   - Real-time loss function display showing how well the curve fits
   - Visual comparison of "low loss" vs "high loss" scenarios
   - Show vertical distance lines from points to curve

2. GRADIENT DESCENT VISUALIZATION
   - Interactive 2D loss surface where users can click to set initial position
   - Animated gradient descent showing:
     * Forward pass: calculating loss from parameters
     * Backward pass: computing gradients via chain rule
   - Display of partial derivatives ∂Loss/∂k₁, ∂Loss/∂k₂, etc.
   - Step-by-step breakdown showing how each parameter adjustment affects loss
   - "Manual mode": let user nudge parameters randomly vs "Auto mode": using gradients

3. DERIVATIVES EXPLAINED SIMPLY
   - Section titled "What ARE Derivatives in Machine Learning?"
   - Visual explanation:
     * "Derivatives tell you which way to turn the knob"
     * "How much the output changes when you nudge the input"
     * Show a curve with a tangent line
   - Interactive example: single slider that controls one parameter
   - Display the derivative value and show the predicted vs actual change
   - Analogy: "Like asking 'if I take one step right, will I go up or down?'"

4. CHAIN RULE VISUALIZATION
   - Show a computational graph with connected nodes
   - Each node represents a simple operation (multiply, add, square, etc.)
   - Interactive: click a node to highlight the path from input to output
   - Demonstrate chain rule with "gear wheels" metaphor:
     * "When you turn the first wheel, it turns the second wheel"
     * "The amount it turns depends on the derivative (gear ratio)"
   - Show both forward pass (left to right) and backward pass (right to left)
   - Display intermediate values and gradients at each step

5. COMPUTATIONAL GRAPH BUILDER
   - Let users build their own simple computational graphs
   - Drag-and-drop operations: +, ×, square, exp, log
   - Connect nodes with arrows
   - Run forward pass to see values propagate
   - Run backward pass to see gradients flow back
   - Display gradient values at each node

6. HYPERPARAMETERS VS PARAMETERS
   - Clear distinction with visual examples:
     * Parameters (k0-k5): "The knobs we're optimizing"
     * Hyperparameters: "Settings that control HOW we optimize"
   - Examples of hyperparameters:
     * Learning rate (step size)
     * Number of iterations
     * Batch size
   - Interactive: adjust learning rate and watch how gradient descent behaves
   - Show what happens with too high/too low learning rate

7. FORWARD AND BACKWARD PASS BREAKDOWN
   - Split-screen view showing both passes simultaneously
   - Forward Pass section:
     * "Computing the prediction"
     * Show data flowing through the network
     * Calculate loss at the end
   - Backward Pass section:
     * "Computing how to improve"
     * Show gradients flowing backward
     * Calculate ∂Loss/∂parameter for each parameter
   - Step-through animation with play/pause controls

================================================================================
ADVANCED TOPICS (ADDITIONAL SECTIONS)
================================================================================

8. ATTENTION MECHANISMS IN TRANSFORMERS
   - Visual explanation: "Attention is about focusing on relevant parts"
   - Interactive attention head demonstration:
     * Input sequence of words/tokens
     * Show Query, Key, Value matrices
     * Visualize attention weights as heatmap
   - Multi-head attention:
     * "Different heads focus on different aspects"
     * Show 4-8 attention heads looking at same sequence
     * Each head highlights different word relationships
   - Self-attention calculation walkthrough:
     * Q×K^T to get attention scores
     * Softmax to normalize
     * Multiply by V to get output

9. DEEP LAYERS AND NETWORK DEPTH
   - Visual representation of shallow vs deep networks
   - Interactive: add/remove layers and see effect on learning
   - Explain hierarchical feature learning:
     * Layer 1: edges and simple patterns
     * Layer 2: shapes and textures
     * Layer 3: objects and complex features
   - Challenges with depth:
     * Vanishing gradients visualization
     * Show gradient magnitude decreasing through layers
   - Solutions: residual connections, normalization

10. MULTI-TASK LEARNING
    - Diagram showing shared trunk with multiple task-specific heads
    - Interactive: select which tasks to train simultaneously
    - Demonstrate task separation strategies:
      * Hard parameter sharing: single backbone, multiple heads
      * Soft parameter sharing: separate networks with regularization
      * Task-specific layers vs shared layers
    - Visual: show how gradients from different tasks influence shared parameters
    - When to separate tasks:
      * Conflicting gradients
      * Very different data distributions
      * Different scales of loss

11. LOGISTIC VS LINEAR PROBLEMS
    - Side-by-side comparison:
      * Linear: predicting continuous values (regression)
      * Logistic: predicting categories (classification)
    - Interactive examples:
      * Linear: predict house prices from size
      * Logistic: predict if email is spam (yes/no)
    - Visual distinction:
      * Linear: straight line fit
      * Logistic: S-curve (sigmoid function)
    - When to use which:
      * Continuous output → Linear
      * Binary/categorical output → Logistic
      * Show loss functions: MSE vs Cross-Entropy
